# Games Navmesh + Character animation
Navmesh dictates which areas of the scenes are walkable or not. In my scene, I set the ground as walkable and the walls as unwalkable for everything to look more natural.

My character animation consists of an idle pose + a walking animation when character is moved. I have also used object collision for it to look more cohesive.
